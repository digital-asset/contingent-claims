-- | Return the fixing dates of a claim. This does not discriminate between

-- would remove a choice for 'inaction' from the bearer - think option lapse).
-- However, we don't handle the case for `Or > 1`, as this can be unintuitive
-- (although semantically correct); this may change in the future, so don't rely
-- on this behaviour.

-- | Returns the claim's implied acquisition time (IAT) if it exists.
-- It is defined as the time `t` such that, for the purpose of lifecycling and valuation, it is irrelevant whether the contract has been acquired at `t` or at any time `s` before `t`.
-- This check is required as currently the claim's acquisition time is not an input to `lifecycle`, which forces us to work with claims that have an IAT.
-- For instance: 
-- - `Scale obs c` does not have an IAT (as `obs` is evaluated at the claim's acquisition time)
-- - the IAT for `When (TimeGte t) c` is `t`
-- - `When (obs <= 100) c` does not have an IAT, as the acquisition time defines when we start to monitor the observable `obs`
