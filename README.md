# Contingent Claims

This is a library for modelling contingent claims i.e. derivatives. Briefly, a
derivative is represnted by a tree of `Claim`s, which describe the futures
cashflows between two (implicit) parties.

The implementation follows closely the papers [[1]](#1), [[2]](#2).

# Dependencies

There is a dependency on `Daml.Control.Recursion` which is currently provided
through a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

# Building

First off, if `daml-ctl` directory is empty, remember to:

```
git submodule init && git submodule update
```

You can build a release version (no tests in the `*.dar`) by running `daml
build` in the root directory, or a dev version that includes test from
`daml-test`.
