# Contingent Claims

This is a library for modeling contingent claims, i.e. derivatives, written in the smart contract language [Daml](https://www.digitalasset.com/developers). Briefly, a derivative is represented by a tree of `Claim`s, which describe future cashflows between two parties as well as the conditions under which these cashflows occur.

The library offers life-cycling capabilities, as well as a valuation semantics that maps a claim to a mathematical expression that can be used for no-arbitrage pricing.

The implementation closely follows the model outlined in the papers [[1]](#1), [[2]](#2).

To get started, we recommend reading through the [quickstart](./QUICKSTART.md) document.

Examples of how to create and lifecycle contracts can be found in the [test directory](./test/daml/Test/FinancialContract.daml).

## How to use this library

To use the library in your Daml project, it is sufficient to download the latest `*.dar` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/digital-asset/contingent-claims/releases/) and add it as a dependency to your project.

## Releases

Releases adhere to the 'semantic versioning' specification. Breaking changes across major versions are documented in [Upgrading.md](./UPGRADING.md).

## Building the code

In order to build the code from source, follow these instructions.

1. Clone the repository

2. Make sure a version of the [Daml SDK](https://docs.daml.com/getting-started/installation.html) is installed on your machine

3. Fetch the `*.dar` file for the latest version of the [daml-ctl](https://github.com/digital-asset/daml-ctl/releases) library and copy it to the `lib/` folder in the repository's root

4. You can then build a release version (no tests in the `*.dar`) by running `daml build` in the root directory, or a dev version that includes tests from the `test` directory.

### Running the tests

Navigate to the `test` directory and run `daml test`.

### Generating source code documentation

Make sure that `make` is installed on your machine.

Source-code documentation can be generated by running `make doc` from the repository's root folder.

## Contribution Policy

If you wish to contribute to this project, please contact us first via Github. In future, we do plan to accept external contributions, contingent on the Digital Asset CLA.
