The HTML documentation in **this branch** is generated in the CI via the `make` target `publish-api-doc`. It is published to github pages https://digital-asset.github.io/contingent-claims/ .

Changes you make directly in `docs/*.HTML` will be **overwritten** on the next release. It's ok to change the template files under `docs/da-style` though.
